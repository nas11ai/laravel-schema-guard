# SchemaGuard (Work In Progress)

**SchemaGuard** is a Laravel package that protects your database from destructive migrations by detecting schema drift and providing safety guards for dangerous operations.

SchemaGuard aimed to support **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** databases.

Currently, SchemaGuard is still in development. Please use with caution.
